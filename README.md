## Issues

There are two issues this project demonstrates.

### IE 10

The first is clicking a scrollbar causes an immediate blur event for any element that has focus regardless of preventDefault() callbacks.

### Custom Browser

The second is mouse down causes an immediate blur for any element that has focus regardless of preventDefault() callbacks.
